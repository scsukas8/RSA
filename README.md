# RSA
This repo contains an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm for Advanced Programming Techniques at Georgia Tech.

RSA.cc can be used to generate an RSA encrption pair of any number of bits, while BreakRSA.cc can be used to crack an RSA encryption of theortically any number of bits. The factoring algorithm used to break the encryption is optimal for keys of less than 70 bits. Breaking encyption of more commonly used 2048 bit keys is currently considered computationally infeasable, thus is a secure means of encyption.
